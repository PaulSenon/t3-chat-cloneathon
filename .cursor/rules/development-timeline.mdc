## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Common Blockers & Solutions
**API Key Issues**
- Solution: Set up all API keys on Day 1
- Backup: Use test/mock responses during development

**Integration Complexity**
- Solution: Test each integration individually
- Backup: Simplify features if integration takes too long

**Deployment Issues**
- Solution: Deploy early and often (after Day 1)
- Backup: Have local demo ready as fallback

**Performance Problems**
- Solution: Optimize as you build, not at the end
- Backup: Feature flags to disable heavy features

### Time Buffer Strategy
- **Day 1**: Build buffer into Hour 7-8
- **Day 2**: Focus on core features, skip bonuses if needed
- **Day 3**: Prioritize deployment over additional features
